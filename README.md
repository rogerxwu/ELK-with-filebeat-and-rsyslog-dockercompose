# ELK-with-filebeat-and-rsyslog-dockercompose
A containlized log analysis service, built with elastic + Logstash + Kibana + filebeat + rsyslog.

Project background:
A large number of network devices and servers are usually deployed in an enterprise environment. When a device fails, decentralized log management will make it difficult to recover the log of the failed device. The troubleshooting process requires cumbersome collection of log information of the associated device. And it is difficult to monitor the abnormalities of the equipment in real time. The centralized log management analysis service can effectively improve the efficiency of troubleshooting, and can detect man-made or non-man-made equipment abnormalities in time.

Reference: 
This project refers to the source code of https://github.com/gnokoheat/elk-with-filebeat-by-docker-compose, and carries out follow-up development

Project Workflowï¼š
device logs -> server rsyslog -> filebeat -> logstash -> elasticsearch -> kibana

Project tutorial:
Part 1: Configure the log server and clients to achieve centralized log reception
1. Configure the log server: replace the rsyslog.conf file to /etc/rsyslog.conf
3. Configure clients such as network devices
4. Check the log collection

Part 2: ELKB service is online
1. Install docker and docker-compose on the server
2. Download the code
3. Modify the docker-compose.yml and filebeat.yml files according to the log storage location, ensure that the filebeat in docker-compose is mounted to the correct log folder, and confirm in failbeat that the file is correctly used as the input source
4. Run docker-compose
5. Modify the lostash configuration file and template file as required
